# Security Policy for ModularPress

Security and operational stability are core priorities for ModularPress.

This document explains how to report a security related issue. It does not replace any contractual security terms you may have in a commercial agreement.

## Supported versions

Security support applies to ModularPress installations that:

- Run a version that is under active support in your commercial agreement  
- Are installed according to the official documentation  
- Have not been modified in a way that bypasses security controls

If you are unsure whether your installation is supported, contact us through your usual commercial channel.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue related to ModularPress, follow these rules:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue or pull request**  
   Public reports can expose other installations to unnecessary risk.

2. **Send a private report** using one of the following:

   - Use the contact form at https://modularpress.eu/contact and mention that the message is a security report  
   - Or use the dedicated security contact information provided in your commercial agreement

3. **Include as much detail as possible**, for example:

   - A clear description of the issue  
   - Steps to reproduce, including sample data where possible  
   - What environment you tested on  
   - Any logs or screenshots that help understand the impact

Avoid sending sensitive data such as real passwords or full database dumps.

## What to expect

When you send a security report through the private channel:

- The report will be acknowledged as soon as reasonably possible  
- The issue will be investigated and validated  
- If confirmed, a remediation plan and patch schedule will be prepared  
- Affected customers will be informed according to internal procedures

Public disclosure details will be coordinated with you if relevant. Please do not publish details of the issue before a fix is available and deployed.

- Misconfigurations of web servers, firewalls or third party services
