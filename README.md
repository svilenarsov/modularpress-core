## What is ModularPress

ModularPress is a **commercial modular CMS admin panel** designed for teams that need structure, clarity and control instead of plugin driven chaos.

It is not a theme.  
It is not a plugin marketplace.  
It is a focused administrative system built to manage content, users and configuration in a predictable and scalable way.

ModularPress is developed and maintained by **Network Technology** and is used in real production systems, internal tools and long term maintained projects.

## Core philosophy

ModularPress is built around a simple idea:

> Administrative systems should behave like products, not experiments.

Every part of the system follows clear rules:

- Explicit architecture instead of hidden magic  
- Predictable data structures  
- Clear separation of responsibilities  
- No dependency on fragile visual builders  
- No uncontrolled third party plugin ecosystem  

The goal is to provide a stable admin panel that teams can rely on for years.

## Key features

- Modular and predictable architecture  
- Clean PHP 8 codebase with strict typing  
- PDO based database layer and explicit SQL  
- Clear separation between content, users and configuration  
- Performance oriented design  
- Built for real world production environments  

---

## Modular architecture

Each module in ModularPress is fully independent and self contained.

Modules include their own:

- Database tables  
- Permissions and access rules  
- Admin UI screens  
- Business logic  

There are no hidden dependencies between modules and no global plugin chaos.

You enable only what your project actually needs.
